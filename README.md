# Dog Api Project Work in Progress...
# Dog Api Project

*Project Title:* A Dog Breeds Information Website
*Description:* People can visit our dog breed website that features random images of dogs for many reasons. Some people may simply enjoy looking at pictures of dogs, as they find them cute and endearing. Others may be looking for inspiration or ideas for a specific breed of dog that they are interested in adopting. For example, a person might visit a website with random images of dogs to get a better sense of what a particular breed looks like in terms of size, coat color, and overall appearance. Additionally, a website with random images of dogs could be a fun way to pass the time and take a break from other tasks or responsibilities. Overall, a website with random images of dogs can provide enjoyment, education, and inspiration for people who are interested in these beloved animals. That is why we created this page.
*Main Features Include:*
- Search Function: Allows users to filder breeds by type. Each breed contains information about their height, weight, breed group, lifespan, and temperament
- Drop-down menu: Provide users with the ability to view images of specific breeds by selecting them from a drop-down menu
- Button Generator: Include a button that allows users to generate random dog images
- MongoDB Atlas: Utilizing MongoDB Atlas to securely store user sign-up credentials, such as email and password, and allowing users to authenticate themselves by  
  verifying their credentials.
*Installation*

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
